# Pull request
Once you've finished your work and tested it, make sure you rebase on the latest changes to dev in the main repo, then push your branch to your fork then open up a pull request to the main repo. Leave the pull request title as the branch name but add "closes #x" if your pull request is addressing ticket x, and enter a description of what your changes do and any decisions you made while working on it.

You should assign the people responsible for reviewing your pull request. These details can be found in the CODEOWNERS file. Don't be scared to mis-assign someone, they'll notice it and let you know for future reference.

Don't be worried if your changes fail some of the status checks or get a lot of requested changes, that's the reason why we have pull request reviews!
